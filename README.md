## About the Project
swirlingLeaves is our group Narvia's Sprint Implementation project where 13 of us QA Testers are assigned individual User Stories.

We will manually test these stories in JIRA X-Ray then automate them in our IDE- IntelliJ.

This sprint is only one week: 7/17/2023-7/21/2023. We are using Agile-Scrum methodology, starting with the Grooming/Planning meeting, 
followed by daily Stand Up meetings, and ending with the Demo/Retrospective meeting.
