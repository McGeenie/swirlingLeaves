## About the Project
SwirlingLeaves is our group Narvia's Sprint Implementation project where 13 of us QA Testers are assigned individual User Stories.

We will manally test these assigned User Stories in JIRA X-Ray then automate them in our IDE- IntelliJ using Cucumber BDD framework.

This sprint is only one week: 7/17/2023-7/21/2023. We are using Agile-Scrum methodology, starting with the Grooming/Planning meeting, 
followed by daily Stand Up meetings, and ending with the Demo/Retrospective meeting.
